Disclaimer\+: This is not a production DB and is limited in capabilities in what it can do. The goal of the project was to learn out the DB internals. It should not be considered a replacement for a DB leave alone a replacement for SQLlite.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{Reason to work on this}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
I wanted to make my current knowledge of C++ by making something that is fun. So relational DB is what we make.

The project is inspired from \href{https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial}{\texttt{ https\+://cstack.\+github.\+io/db\+\_\+tutorial}}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{What it does?}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
1) This is a append only database, which means deletes are not supported.

2) This only supports one table for now, whose schema looks like
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item int id
\item string email
\item string username 
\end{DoxyItemize}
